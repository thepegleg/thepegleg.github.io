## Make your own access point

### freedns.afraid.org (SUPER EASY) (Now with SSL!) (New server!)

Create an A record with `104.36.86.105` as the IP

#### note: use the non default domains, the others are usually auto blocked

#### other note: I can see what domains you use, and they will be added to the public domain list

### Use a template

Easy way, follow instructions at [ThePlank](https://github.com/sebastian-92/ThePlank/README.md)

### Custom access point

To make a custom access point, put this html anywhere on your website. the only thing you can't edit is the link, everything else should be fine:

```
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="var newTab = window.open('about:blank'); newTab.document.write('<head><title>Classroom</title><link rel=\'icon\' type=\'image/png\' href=\'gc.png\'></head><embed allowfullscreen=\'true\'src=\'https://hfhjdkfghsdfkjghsdfjkhg.cbass92.org/asdjklhfskjafhakfhueoyraehfjkcnjkdscnsjakdreuoiwefh/index.html\' style=\'position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;\'>'); return false;" style="text-decoration: none;">Atlas</a>
